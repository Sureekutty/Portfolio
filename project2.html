        <h2>"Automated Timetable Generator"</h2>
        <article>
        
           
            <p>Most colleges have a number of different courses, and each course has a number of subjects. Now there are limited faculties, with each faculty teaching more than one subject. The timetable needed to schedule the faculty at provided time slots in such a way that their timings do not overlap, and the timetable schedule makes the best use of all faculty subject demands. We use a genetic algorithm for this purpose. In our Timetable Generation algorithm, we propose to utilize a timetable object. This object comprises classroom objects and the timetable for each of them, along with a fitness score for the timetable. The fitness score relates to the number of clashes the timetable has regarding alternate schedules for different classes.<br><br>

            The classroom object comprises week objects, which consist of days. Days comprise time slots, with each time slot linked to a specific subject, student group attending the class, and the instructor teaching the subject. Further discussing the constraints, we have utilized a composite design pattern, making it easily extendable to include or remove as many tasks as necessary. In each task class, the conditions specified in our query are checked between two timetable objects. If the condition is fulfilled, meaning a clash is present, the score is incremented by one.<br><br>
                
            In the existing system, each task is carried out manually, making processing tedious and inefficient. The organization often fails to meet its needs on time, and the results may not be accurate. Users may have to format the output after it is prepared, leading to difficulties. Some disadvantages of the manual system include increased transactions leading to a greater volume of source documents, complicating maintenance, and the challenge of correcting incorrect student or staff entries.<br><br>
                
            The proposed system is designed to be more efficient than the manual system. Faculty members need not worry about time clashes, and authorities no longer need to perform permutations and combinations. This system allows them to concentrate on other priorities rather than waste time preparing the timetable. It automates all tasks that were previously handled manually, including forms, transactions, and reports.<br><br>
                
            The advantages of the proposed system include providing accurate information, simplifying manual work, minimizing documentation-related tasks, providing up-to-date information, and creating a friendly environment by offering warning messages.<br><br>
