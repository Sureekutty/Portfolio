        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am Sureendhar J, an aspiring Java Full Stack Developer driven by a strong passion for technology and a commitment to continuous learning and growth.<br><br>

            I am currently pursuing an intensive training program at JSpiders Basavanagudi, where I am enhancing my expertise in full stack development. This comprehensive course covers a wide range of technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and SQL. It equips me with the skills necessary to master both front-end and back-end development practices, enabling me to create responsive and user-friendly web applications. I am particularly focused on applying best practices in coding, UI/UX design, and database management to develop efficient and effective solutions.<br><br>

            I was placed at Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTS) through my college placement program and completed my internship from March 2023 to September 2023, specializing in CyberArk Privileged Access Management (PAM). This experience has provided me with valuable insights into PAM and its importance in securing applications and managing user access.
            <br><br>

            I graduated in 2023 from KSR College of Engineering in Tiruchengode, Tamil Nadu, where I honed my analytical skills and gained a comprehensive understanding of computer science principles, programming languages, and software development methodologies. My time at KSR College provided me with the necessary tools to tackle complex programming challenges effectively, fostering my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.<br><br>

            I completed my schooling at Sri Vidhya Mandhir A. Matriculation Higher Secondary School, where I developed a strong interest in computer science and programming. This early exposure ignited my curiosity about technology and set me on the path toward a career in software development.<br><br>

            As part of my training and experience, I undertook a project on IoT service improvement through hybrid fog-cloud offloading. This project challenged me to apply my theoretical knowledge to practical challenges, as I researched and implemented strategies to enhance the efficiency of IoT services. This experience not only sharpened my technical skills but also taught me the importance of collaboration and innovation in problem-solving.<br><br>

            In addition to my technical pursuits, I believe in being an active member of my community and engaging in extracurricular activities. As an NCC cadet, I earned four camp certificates along with A, B, and C certificates, reflecting my commitment to discipline and teamwork. I participated in community initiatives such as blood donation camps and the Swachh Bharat event, demonstrating my dedication to social responsibility and service. These experiences have shaped my character, teaching me the value of leadership, collaboration, and giving back to society.
            <br><br>

            Outside of my academic and professional endeavors, I enjoy exploring new technologies and trends in software development. I find joy in engaging in team sports, which not only keeps me physically active but also enhances my teamwork and communication skills. Additionally, I participate in community service projects, as I am passionate about making a positive impact in the lives of others. Known for my boldness and effective leadership skills, I am eager to contribute to innovative projects in the tech industry. I am driven by a desire to create impactful and secure applications that meet user and business needs, and I look forward to the opportunities ahead in my professional journey.<br><br>
